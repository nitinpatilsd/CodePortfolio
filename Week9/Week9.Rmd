## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Plotting Systems
The Base Plotting System

```{r}
data(airquality)
with(airquality, { plot(Temp, Ozone) + lines(loess.smooth(Temp, Ozone))})

```

```{r}
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
title("Speed vs. Stopping distance")

```

The Lattice System

```{r}
library(lattice)

```

```{r}
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))
```

The ggplot2 System

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

```

```{r}
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)
```

The Process of Making a Plot
How Does a Plot Get Created?
There are two basic approaches to plotting. 

```{r}
## Make plot appear on screen device
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting)) 
## Annotate with a title
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  
```

```{r}
## Open PDF device; create 'myplot.pdf' in my working directory
pdf(file = "myplot.pdf")  
## Create plot and send to a file (no plot appears on screen)
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))  
## Annotate plot; still nothing on screen
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  
## Close the PDF file device
dev.off()  
## Now you can view the file 'myplot.pdf' on your computer

```

Multiple Open Graphics Devices
Copying Plots

```{r}
 library(datasets)
## Create plot on screen device
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))  
## Add a main title
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data")  
## Copy my plot to a PNG file
dev.copy(png, file = "geyserplot.png")  
## Don't forget to close the PNG device!
dev.off()  

```

```{r}

```
