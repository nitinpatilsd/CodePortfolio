## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
flights
```

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```

Comparisons

```{r}
#filter(flights, month = 1)
```

```{r}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
```

```{r}
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)
near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
```

Logical operators

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```

```{r}
nov_dec <- filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

```{r}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```
Missing values

```{r}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
```

```{r}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
```

```{r}
is.na(x)
```

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)

```

```{r}
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

Arrange rows with arrange()

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, x)
```

```{r}
arrange(df, desc(x))
```

Select columns with select()

```{r}
# Select columns by name
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

```{r}
select(flights, year:day)
```

```{r}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```

```{r}
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```

```{r}
select(flights, time_hour, air_time, everything())
```

```{r}
vars <- c("year", "month", "day", "dep_delay", "arr_delay")
```

```{r}
select(flights, contains("TIME"))
```

Add new variables with mutate()

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

```{r}
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

```{r}
transmute(flights,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```

Useful creation functions

```{r}
transmute(flights,
  dep_time,
  hour = dep_time %/% 100,
  minute = dep_time %% 100
)
```

```{r}
(x <- 1:10)
lag(x)
lead(x)
```

```{r}
x
cumsum(x)
cummean(x)
```

```{r}
y <- c(1, 2, 2, NA, 3, 4)
min_rank(y)
min_rank(desc(y))
```

```{r}
row_number(y)
dense_rank(y)
percent_rank(y)
cume_dist(y)
```

Grouped summaries with summarise()

```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Combining multiple operations with the pipe

```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarise(by_dest,
  count = n(),
  dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
  delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
)
delay <- filter(delay, count > 20, dest != "HNL")

# It looks like delays increase with distance up to ~750 miles 
# and then decrease. Maybe as flights get longer there's more 
# ability to make up delays in the air?
ggplot(data = delay, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

```

```{r}
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```

Missing values

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))

```

Counts

```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay)
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = delay)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 10)

```

```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>% 
  summarise(
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )

ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```

```{r}
delays %>% 
  filter(n > 25) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = delay)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 1/10)
```

```{r}
# Convert to a tibble so it prints nicely
batting <- as_tibble(Lahman::Batting)

batters <- batting %>% 
  group_by(playerID) %>% 
  summarise(
    ba = sum(H, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(AB, na.rm = TRUE),
    ab = sum(AB, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

batters %>% 
  filter(ab > 100) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ab, y = ba)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'
```

```{r}
batters %>% 
  arrange(desc(ba))
```

Useful summary functions
```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_delay1 = mean(arr_delay),
    avg_delay2 = mean(arr_delay[arr_delay > 0]) # the average positive delay
  )
```

```{r}
# Why is distance to some destinations more variable than to others?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(distance_sd = sd(distance)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(distance_sd))
```

```{r}
# When do the first and last flights leave each day?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first = min(dep_time),
    last = max(dep_time)
  )
```

```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(
    first_dep = first(dep_time), 
    last_dep = last(dep_time)
  )
```

```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  mutate(r = min_rank(desc(dep_time))) %>% 
  filter(r %in% range(r))
```

```{r}
# Which destinations have the most carriers?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(carriers = n_distinct(carrier)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(carriers))
```

```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  count(dest)
```

```{r}
not_cancelled %>% 
  count(tailnum, wt = distance)
```

```{r}
# How many flights left before 5am? (these usually indicate delayed
# flights from the previous day)
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(n_early = sum(dep_time < 500))
```

```{r}
# What proportion of flights are delayed by more than an hour?
not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(hour_perc = mean(arr_delay > 60))
```

Grouping by multiple variables

```{r}
daily <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
(per_day   <- summarise(daily, flights = n()))

```

```{r}
(per_month <- summarise(per_day, flights = sum(flights)))
```

```{r}
(per_year  <- summarise(per_month, flights = sum(flights)))
```

Ungrouping

```{r}
daily %>% 
  ungroup() %>%             # no longer grouped by date
  summarise(flights = n())  # all flights
```

Grouped mutates (and filters)

```{r}
flights_sml %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  filter(rank(desc(arr_delay)) < 10)
```

```{r}
popular_dests <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  filter(n() > 365)
popular_dests
```

```{r}
popular_dests %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 0) %>% 
  mutate(prop_delay = arr_delay / sum(arr_delay)) %>% 
  select(year:day, dest, arr_delay, prop_delay)
```
